# Time Line Tool
This java app is used for _bilingual_ transcript. User needs two `.txt` files.
<br/>The one is `timestamp.txt` 
<br/>The other one is  `translation.txt`

The program will find the __Dialogue line__ in `timestamp.txt` and make them twice. Then on each __Dialogue line__, append each line on `translation.txt` corespondingly.

Tip: you need to convert it to `.ass` file manually.
